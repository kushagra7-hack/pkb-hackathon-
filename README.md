# Legal Literacy (Next.js 15) - Upgraded

This is an upgraded Next.js 15 starter site for **Legal Awareness for Citizens**.
It includes a polished UI, client/server component separation, search, quizzes,
VS Code settings, and a Vercel deployment config.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Notes
- Uses App Router (`app/`) and `app/layout.jsx` which is required for Next.js 13+ App Router.
- Client components are marked with `'use client'`.
- Seed data lives in `data/lessons.json`.
